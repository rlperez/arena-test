// The attached text file contains the favorite musical artists of 1000 users from Some Popular Music Review Website. Each line is a list of up to 50 artists, formatted as follows:
//
// Radiohead,Pulp,Morrissey,Delays,Stereophonics,Blur,Suede,Sleeper,The La's,Super Furry Animals,Iggy Pop\nâ€¨Band of Horses,Smashing Pumpkins,The Velvet Underground,Radiohead,The Decemberists,Morrissey,Television\n
// etc.
//
// Write a program that, using this file as input, produces an output file containing a list of pairs of artists which appear
// TOGETHER in at least fifty different lists. For example, in the above sample, Radiohead and Morrissey appear together twice,
// but every other pair appears only once. Your solution should be a csv, with each row being a pair. For example:
//
// Morrissey,Radiohead\n
//
// Your solution MAY return a best guess, i.e. pairs which appear at least 50 times with high probability, as long as you
// explain why this tradeoff improves the performance of the algorithm. Please include, either in comments or in a separate
// file, a brief one-paragraph description of any optimizations you made and how they impact the run-time of the algorithm.
